# Quick Union

This is an improvement on the Quick Find Union Find algo. QFUF had a quadratic run time aka O(n^2). Quick Union still has a quadratic run time but it is still faster.

It implements this through the use of a tree like structure. Don't freak out. It's not an actual tree inside each array element. But the idea is virtually the same.

## Sorry Need to add to this. Will do it later.
