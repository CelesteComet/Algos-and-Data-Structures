# Merge Sort

# What does it do?
Merge Sort is a sorting algo that applies the principle of divide and conquer on an array. Why apply this principle? Well sorting a smaller array is easier than sorting a large array. And that's true even more so when we have an array of length 1. We can then join the arrays to form an ordered array

### What we need to implement
1. mergeSort which recursively calls itself
2. split which splits the array in half
3. merge which sorts the two arrays into one array

### Note:
This implementation is taken from a Full Stack Academy Workshop.

The coursera course implements a classic version of merge sort using insertion sort as its sorting algo. But the basis is the same.
