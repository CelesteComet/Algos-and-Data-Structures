# Insertion Sort

### What is it?
Insertion sort relies on the concept of dividing a list into sorted and unsorted sections. It iterates through the list and moves each unsorted element into its proper place in the sorted section.

Because we potentially need to check the current unsorted element against every element in the sorted section, this algorithm has a run time of O(n^2), or a "quadratic" run time.
