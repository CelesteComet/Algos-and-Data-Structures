# Queues

### The Queue

Queses are very similar to Stacks except for some terminology and a few key features.

Adding to the queue we add to the front. Removing from the Queue we remove from the end. This is the same as if you were on line for something like say a line to see the movie Rogue One. The implementation of a queue will be very similar to the Stack.

`enqueue` is adding to Queue
`dequeue` is removing from Queue
