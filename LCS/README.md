# Longest Common Subsequence

### Problem

Write a function called LCS that returns the longest subsequence common to the two passed in sequences.

A subsequence is a collection of characters that maintains the same order but does not need to be consecutive.

For example:

sequence one is 'abc'
sequence two is 'axyzc'

subsequencesOne = 'a', 'b', 'c', 'ab', 'ac', 'bc'
  Notice how 'ac' is a subsequence that skips the letter b

LCS('abc', 'axyzc') = 'ac'

### Note:
Implement LCS using dynamic programming
