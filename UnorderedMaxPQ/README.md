# Unordered Max Priority Queue

## What is it?
It is just like the Queue data structure but with each element weighted. When we are adding to the queue things are added the same way. BUT when we are removing things from the queue we are removing the MAX/MIN weighted element regardless of where they are placed in the Queue.

This means that the elements in the Queue must be comparable in some way.

## What do we need?

`insert` add element to the array

`del(Max|Min)` removes max/min key in Queue

`isEmpty` checks if is empty

`exchange` swap two elements in the array
