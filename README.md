# Collection of Algorithms and Data Structures

## Starting
1. run `npm install`
2. Select Algo/Data Structure you want to work on
  * remove `x` from `xdescribe` in the `.test.js` file
  * Add `.only` to the first `describe` in the `.test.js` file
  * like so: `describe.only('FANCY ALGO', () => {})`
3. run `npm test`
4. ???
5. Profit

## Description
Each folder contains the solution, an empty file, and a file for the test specs. Most files also include a README describing the data structure or algo as well as the functions you need to implement.

Most of these implementations are what I have learned from the Coursera Princton Introduction to Algos Course, Part 1 and 2, and at Fullstack Academy. Although the Coursera course is in Java, I've implemented it in JavaScript.

I have written extensive test specs so others can use this repo to do test first learning. And also to check if the functions I wrote were actually doing what they were supposed to :joy:.

### Note:

A couple of the algorithms and data structures do not yet have test specs. Also the README's could be better. Will get on that...eventually...

Said Stuff:

1. Test Specs
  * All sorting algos
  * KnuthShuffle
  * Heap Sort Readme
  * Graphs
    * bfs
    * dfs
2. Write better README's for sorting algos

### Coming Soon:

1. Suffix Tree
2. Topological Sort (using Tarjan's algorithm)
3. Dijkstra's Algorithm
4. Longest Common Subsequence (using dynamic programming)
5. Knapsack Problem (using dynamic programming)
