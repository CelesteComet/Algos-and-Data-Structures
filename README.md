# Collection of Algorithms and Data Structures

## Starting
1. run `npm install`
2. Select Algo/Data Structure you want to work on
  * remove `x` from `xdescribe` in the `.test.js` file
  * Add `.only` to the first `describe` in the `.test.js` file
  * like so: `describe.only('FANCY ALGO', () => {})`
3. run `npm test`
4. ???
5. Profit

### Source
  Each folder contains the solution, an empty file, and a file for the test specs


### Most of these implementations are what I have learned from the Coursera Princton Introduction to Algos Part 1 Course

### TODO:
1. Test Specs
  * All sorting algos
  * WeightedQuickUnion
  * WeightedQuickUnionPath Compressed
  * KnuthShuffle
2. Maybe write better README's for sorting algos
