# Heap Sort

# What does it do?
Sorts a Binary Heap. Very similar to BinaryHeapMaxPq implementation.

# How does it sort?
First we must go through the tree and construct it to be a tree that is a Binary Heap Max Priority Queue. Then we need to start exchanging the elements down throughout the tree.
